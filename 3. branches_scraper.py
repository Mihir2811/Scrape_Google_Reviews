"""
This script uses SerpApi to search Google Maps for all "Honest" restaurant branches located in Gujarat, India. 
It automates the process of finding and storing place details (such as name, address, rating, and review count) 
for each branch returned by the search query.

Main features:
1. Loads the SerpApi API key securely from a .env file.
2. Queries Google Maps for "Honest restaurant Gujarat" using SerpApi.
3. Filters results to include only locations that mention both "Honest" and "Gujarat".
4. Extracts relevant information â€” place ID, title, address, rating, and review count.
5. Saves the collected data into both JSON and CSV formats for further use or analysis.
6. Displays a formatted list of all found branches in the console.

This script is useful for building datasets of business branches or for automating 
local business information gathering through Google Maps search results.
