# Google Maps Review Extraction

This repository provides a collection of Python scripts designed to automate the process of collecting, analyzing, and summarizing Google Maps data — including business locations, detailed place information, and customer reviews.  
It uses **SerpApi** for Google Maps data extraction and **AWS Bedrock (Meta LLaMA 3)** for advanced AI-powered review summarization.

## Project Overview

The project consists of three main scripts that together form a complete data workflow:

| Script | Description | Tools |

| `serpapi_place_reviews_collector.py` | Retrieves details and reviews for a single Google Maps location using SerpApi. | SerpApi, Python |
| `branches_scraper.py` | Searches Google Maps for all “Honest” restaurant branches in Gujarat and exports their details. | SerpApi, Python |
| `review_summarizer_bedrock.py` | Summarizes large sets of reviews using AWS Bedrock’s Meta LLaMA 3 model. | AWS Bedrock, LLaMA 3, Python |

3. Uses Bedrock’s `meta.llama3-70b-instruct-v1:0` model to summarize reviews.
4. Automatically splits and processes large review datasets.
5. Combines multiple summaries into one cohesive report.
6. Focuses on these analysis areas:

   * Customer Experience
   * Product or Service Quality
   * Pricing and Charges
   * Digital Platform Experience
   * Support and Issue Resolution

### Output

* Provides a clear summary of customer sentiment.
